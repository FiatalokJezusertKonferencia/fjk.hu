        Kraig grew up in Australia and had a calling to live and He is working full time in the banking industry but soul winning is his occupation and passion! Our Lord and Mighty Savior saved Kraig from a life threatening situation while mountain bike riding which has inspired him to become an evangelist! He enjoys working passionately with Europe 4 Jesus and witnessing to people of all ages answering the call to serve Christ.

      <p>
        My name is Gábor Horváth. I come from a village called Nágocs, located in the Somogy county with my wife and two sons. My original profession is a music teacher (I got my diploma as a percussion instrument teacher in Debrecen and got my master’s degree in Pécs), but God led me to realize, that beyond my love for percussion instruments I can to more to others, so I was called in 1999 to study at the Sola Scriptura Theological School. I am working as a supporting pastor and a pastor since 2002, and I was also called to be a youth leader for 8 years. During my service I have finished an addiction consultant training at Semmelweis University and since 2006 I regularly work among alcohol, drug and medicine addicts. Our residential rehabilitation program started in 2010, where as a professional leader I try to look over the work done there (find out more at <a href="http://www.alkoholbeteg.hu/" target="_blank">www.alkoholbeteg.hu</a>). In the last 10 years, I have visited many primary and secondary schools as well as camps, and I have made connections with many young people, in order to think together about the questions of addiction and breaking free. I have joined the Seventh - day Adventist church this September and continue my service as a pastor in the area of Balatonlelle.
