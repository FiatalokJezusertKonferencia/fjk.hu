        My name is Gábor Horváth. I come from a village called Nágocs, located in the Somogy county with my wife and two sons. My original profession is a music teacher (I got my diploma as a percussion instrument teacher in Debrecen and got my master’s degree in Pécs), but God led me to realize, that beyond my love for percussion instruments I can to more to others, so I was called in 1999 to study at the Sola Scriptura Theological School. I am working as a supporting pastor and a pastor since 2002, and I was also called to be a youth leader for 8 years. During my service I have finished an addiction consultant training at Semmelweis University and since 2006 I regularly work among alcohol, drug and medicine addicts. Our residential rehabilitation program started in 2010, where as a professional leader I try to look over the work done there (find out more at <a href="http://www.alkoholbeteg.hu/" target="_blank">www.alkoholbeteg.hu</a>). In the last 10 years, I have visited many primary and secondary schools as well as camps, and I have made connections with many young people, in order to think together about the questions of addiction and breaking free. I have joined the Seventh - day Adventist church this September and continue my service as a pastor in the area of Balatonlelle.

        I am grateful to God that He called me when I was young to be a member of the family that is waiting for Him to come again; I have been serving Him as a pastor there for fifteen years. I have a special interest in the Old Testament and the Jewish culture. In my freetime, I like cycling and running.

         I have been serving as a pastor for seven years.In spite of the changes, in this period of time there was a constant emphasis on the youth work. In my commitment to this, my own way of life, personal experiences from my adulthood and youth had and have an important role. It is an inspiring challenge as a family man to stay young, make progress, and strengthen my faith at the same time.I have learnt the most from the youth about how faithfulness and credibility is equally important.

      <p>
         I was born in 1956, and currently live in Győr. I was teaching all age groups as a biology and art teacher for twenty years. I got my second degree at the Sola Scriptura theological college in 1993, and from that time, I was teaching Bible and Fine arts class until 2014. Since 1996, I am working as a pastor and missionary in God’s work. My wife, Zsuzsanna Horváth is also my coworker. I used to organize reading camps for young people (ages 14-20). Lately, in the past seven years we were organising scout camps for children (ages 7-14) with our coworkers. Also, in about the last 15 years, I was leading lifestyle camps. Since 1988, I am holding meetings and series mostly in western Hungary about topics like the Bible, healthy lifestyle, creation and evolution, child and youth rearing, and marriage care. I have summed up my researches and experiences in nine books. The goal of my work with the youth is to strengthen the boys and girls in their mission and vocation, „That our sons may be as plants grown up in their youth; that our daughters may be as corner stones, polished after the similitude of a palace” (Psalms 144:12).
