      <h3>From addiction to mercy</h3>
      <span class="small">Gábor Horváth</span>
    </div>
    <div class="description">
      <p>
        I am convinced that there are two types of people. One group consists of addicts, the other group consists of those, who deny it. In my opinion, addiction goes together with existence, and through our bondages can we get to the state when we realise that we need a Saviour. I would like to share this process, my personal experiences and the realizations of my service among addicts, and I will also talk about what we can to others in our environment.
