      <h3>The greatest want of this generation and how this involves the youth of the Seventh-day Adventist movement
      <br>
      At the foot of the cross: Gaining Decisions</h3>
      <span>Jan-Harry Cabungcal</span>

      <p>
      Do we live in a world in need of more young men of great intelligence and sophistication? What is the greatest want and need of this generation? How can the youth of the SDA movement be the catalyst and the element needed in this last generation. Can we be the generation that ends the world? This are the questions that we will tackle during this workshop and provide practical applications on reaching: higher than highest human thoughts can reach is Gods ideal for His children.
      <br>
      The bible teaches that we are not only hearers of the word of God but doers. Yet so often, after we share a critical truth with a friend or family member, no decision is made. How can we cooperate with the Holy Spirit in such a way as to gain decisions from many a soul in the valley of decision? How do we make our appeals with power, conviction and confidence? Come and learn how to bring people to the feet of Jesus, and allow the power of the cross for the individual to choose an unhindered life in these last days.

      <h3>Freedom in Christ</h3>
      <span>Róbert Csizmadia</span>
    </div>
    <div class="description">
      <p class="text-center">
        „If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed” - (KJV) John 8:36
      </p>
      <p>
        Redemption does not only provide a possible access to eternal life but it has an impact on our present life as well. This life-experience can be summarised in the phrase „Freedom in Christ”. We are going to explore and examine together this topic with the help of the Bible. How can we characterise this freedom? Being free from something or free to do something? Freedom with boundaries or unrestricted freedom? Or are these the right questions to ask at all?

      <h3>From addiction to mercy</h3>
      <span>Gábor Horváth</span>
    </div>
    <div class="description">
      <p>
        I am convinced that there are two types of people. One group consists of addicts, the other group consists of those, who deny it. In my opinion, addiction goes together with existence, and through our bondages can we get to the state when we realise that we need a Saviour. I would like to share this process, my personal experiences and the realizations of my service among addicts, and I will also talk about what we can to others in our environment.
      </p>

        The covered topics of the seminar will be:

      <h3>„Jesus for the youth.” How to find and keep the youth living in the 21st century with the gospel?</h3>
      <span>Ferenc Dankó</span>
    </div>
    <div class="description">
      <p>
        Without generalizing, anyone who tried to lead young people to God have experienced, that youth work is a great challenge, whether the target group are youth who go to church or those, who live in the world. In the seminars, we try to find an answer to how can we give the gospel to the youth of our generation in a way that they can understand and live by it. What general and specific traits does the work for this generation’s youth have or can have?

      <h3>Where is my place, what is my duty? Mission or struggling in the net of youth? (1Jn 2,14)

      Where is my place, what is my duty? Mission or struggling in the net of youth? (1Jn 2,14) Destruction or building? The pitfalls of a successful life based on the novel ‘A Colobre’ by Dino Buzatti. If everything seems beautiful from the outside, what is the problem eventually? Why do you live and what are you running from? What does you life talk about: Jesus, or Colombre? Pictures of God and distortions of them.
      <br>
      What is the secret of a spiritual life? How will the tree of your life become fruitful? (Jer. 17,5–6) Jesus wants to plant you from the desert next to the river. How can it happen? Where does the invisible roots and branches of your life reach? The secret of growing your root hairs in the direction of the river. What is the bole? Your flowers: the smell of life or the smell of death? Change from the roots - bearing fruits. „My roots will reach to the water, and the dew will lie all night on my branches.” (Jób 29,19)
