My original profession is a music teacher (I got my diploma as a percussion instrument teacher in Debrecen and got my master’s degree in Pécs), but God led me to realize, that beyond my love for percussion instruments I can to more to others, so I was called in 1999 to study at the Sola Scriptura Theological School. I am working as a supporting pastor and a pastor since 2002, and I was also called to be a youth leader for 8 years. During my service I have finished an addiction consultant training at Semmelweis University and since 2006 I regularly work among alcohol, drug and medicine addicts. Our residential rehabilitation program started in 2010, where as a professional leader I try to look over the work done there (find out more at <a href="http://www.alkoholbeteg.hu/" target="_blank">www.alkoholbeteg.hu</a>). In the last 10 years, I have visited many primary and secondary schools as well as camps, and I have made connections with many young people, in order to think together about the questions of addiction and breaking free. I have joined the Seventh - day Adventist church this September and continue my service as a pastor in the area of Balatonlelle.'

I got my second degree at the Sola Scriptura theological college in 1993, and from that time, I was teaching Bible and Fine arts class until 2014. Since 1996, I am working as a pastor and missionary in God’s work. My wife, Zsuzsanna Horváth is also my coworker. I used to organize reading camps for young people (ages 14-20). Lately, in the past seven years we were organising scout camps for children (ages 7-14) with our coworkers. Also, in about the last 15 years, I was leading lifestyle camps. Since 1988, I am holding meetings and series mostly in western Hungary about topics like the Bible, healthy lifestyle, creation and evolution, child and youth rearing, and marriage care. I have summed up my researches and experiences in nine books. The goal of my work with the youth is to strengthen the boys and girls in their mission and vocation, „That our sons may be as plants grown up in their youth; that our daughters may be as corner stones, polished after the similitude of a palace” (Psalms 144:12).'

A recently discovered treasure from the Scripture and the Testimonies gave a new meaning, opened a new dimension for my ministry. New light shone upon well known truths before my eyes. These discoveries played a key role in my joining to the World Church. I hope that by sharing these I may help young people, who desire to work for Christ.'

This are the questions that we will tackle during this workshop and provide practical applications on reaching: higher than highest human thoughts can reach is Gods ideal for His children.<br>The bible teaches that we are not only hearers of the word of God but doers. Yet so often, after we share a critical truth with a friend or family member, no decision is made. How can we cooperate with the Holy Spirit in such a way as to gain decisions from many a soul in the valley of decision? How do we make our appeals with power, conviction and confidence?
