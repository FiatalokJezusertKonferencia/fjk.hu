          bio: 'I\'d had a precise plan for my life, but something came up. He spoke to me. Who, I had thought to be mute. I was mainly into technology, but God took three letters out, turning me toward greater secrets: theology. The questions of life and its miracles made me curious. I never wanted to be a pastor, yet today it is so close to me, and I am even teaching it. I used to avoid to speak about God, but nowadays I hardly do anything else. I didn\'t want to learn any foreign languages, and today I sometimes switch from one to another in a minute. It goes according to the international environment. This is the everyday reality, which I work in. Yet the changes and surprises are not over in my life. There are some, what I really enjoy, for example to make a Masai child smile in Tanzania. And there are some I don\'t like that much, for example how our Church looks like in our society. At present I work as a teacher at Friedensau Adventist University and I am also the head of the only european adventist missionary institute (ADIMIS).'

          description: `
<p>Splits, dissensions and conflicts have always been part of christian history. Many research has been
made on why these splits happen, but we can hardly find studies about reunion and reconciliation in
the Seventh Day Adventist Church. The Hungarian Union Conference had a unique experience in
2015, when after 40 years, 700 people rejoined the world-wide family of the Seventh Day Adventist
Church.</p>

<p>The researcher (in the issue of a theological dissertation) investigated the motivation of reunion,
comparing them to the already existing studies on culture-change, involving 3 major groups.</p>

<p>During the 4 seminar session we will discuss the following questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>How can the hungarian experience give a positive example for the church in resolving virtual
splits?</li>
  <li>How can a better understanding of the psychology of the reunion help us to disperse
concerns, experience integration and increase the efficiency of leadership support?</li>
  <li>How can the understanding and awareness of the stages of change help us to overcome
changes in other aspects of life?</li>
</ul>

<br>

<p>The seminars:</p>

<p>
<ol>
  <li><div>
  <p><strong>The anatomy of the hungarian adventist schisms and the abortive attempts of
reconnection</strong></p>
  <p>With their communist background, the 3 major schisms show us a unique pattern. What are the
recurring patterns? Could similar phenomena happen with different political backgrounds? What can
we learn from the past?</p>
</div></li> 
  
  <li><div>
  <p><strong>The psychology of reunion</strong></p>
  <p>Understanding the method of the research lays the foundation for the authenticity of the results.
How can we expand a sentiment of 30 people to that many person? After 8 unsuccessful trial to
reconnect, what circumstances helped the process of 2015? The patterns of reunion, according to
the analysis of 3 focus group.</p>
</div></li>  

  <li><div>
  <p><strong>William Bridges’ Transition Model and the process of integration</strong></p>
  <p>The results and lessons of the study. Is there a surprise to what we see from the outside or
experience from the inside? How can we use these lessons?</p>
</div></li>  

  <li><div>
  <p><strong>Theological reflections on the biblical bases of reunion</strong></p>
  <p>History is not written by us. 2000 years ago the millennial dividing wall between the Jews and
Gentiles was destroyed. What happened at that time? How can we apply these things today? What
would happen if we followed the biblical way? What are the dividing walls within the church today?
Is there any hope for true unity? Or do we chase shadows?</p>
</div></li>  
</ol>
</p>

<p>What are the leadership challenges of the reunion? The concluding, relevant lessons of the study.</p>

<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> The presentations are built on each other. They are recommended for those, who are able to listen
to all sessions.</p>
