I am especially thankful for the one and a half decades I could spend ministering to afflicted people (homeless people, psychologically wounded people, addicts). Experiencing the ups and downs of a helping profession gave meaning to my theoretical knowledge in theology and pedagogy. When I think of the decades spent either as a pastor or at another responsible position, I am thankful to my Father in heaven for his patient refining-chiseling work.'

However, God took me out of that in an adventurous way, and gave me the opportunity of getting to know Christianism that I had hated before. God seized me; I got baptized in 1992, the next year I got married and I made the scout-promise in the same year. With my wife, I have been serving in multiple fields of ministry in the church – wherever God called us. At the moment, I serve in the re-organized Huenergardt János Frigyes Scout Group with my wife and four children: the youngest is a cub, the eldest serves as a patrol-leader.<br>At present, I am the scout leader of the Hungarian Union of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, I represent the Hungarian Adventist scout groups here.'

The workshop will deal with the fundamental elements that we have learned from the scientific work over the years. You will be surprised to learn that many of the pre-requisites are founded in the word of God and the spirit of prophecy. This workshop would be particularly informative to couples planning to have children in these last days. Come and learn more about how we can have a sharp mind and balanced emotions.'

The year 1888 – the Minneapolis Conference – with its background and aftermath, was just like our situation nowadays: questions of identity, mission, fraternity, signs of the times – ambition, conflicts, spirituality and community.<br>It’s about lessons to learn and it’s about victories as well – so that by contemplating them we draw closer to Him and to each other.

          description: 'The biggest question for us is how to prepare to meet God. It has a special importance to young people. We are waiting for Christ’s return, but if we had the opportunity to choose, we would probably tick the “a bit later” box. Preparation and spiritual growth is often described as staircase, having different phases, but then it resembles a course: we attend the course, cram the material, acquire certain practical skills and then we graduate and become professionals. How does it work in spiritual matters? What is our job and what is the role of the Holy Spirit in this process? What does it mean for a young person  to grow spiritually and to be born again? Can it be separated from an active sense of mission? I prepare to meet God, but how can I share it with others?<br>I would like to encourage young people with my experiences that shaped my faith and strengthened me in my ministry (although I never wanted to be a pastor and refused every call...), and deepened my devotion towards missionary work.'
