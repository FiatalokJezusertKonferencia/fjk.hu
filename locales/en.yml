    FJK is an Adventist conference organized by young people for young
    people. On this yearly occasion the attendees are encouraged by
    sermons, seminars and meeting opportunities to renew their faith,
    to reform their lives, and to actively support the Seventh-day
    Adventist Church, so the Three Angel's Message can reach to the
    whole world during this generation.
