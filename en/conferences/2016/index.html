                <p>My name is Gábor Horváth. I come from a village called Nágocs, located in the Somogy county with my wife and two sons. My original profession is a music teacher (I got my diploma as a percussion instrument teacher in Debrecen and got my master’s degree in Pécs), but God led me to realize, that beyond my love for percussion instruments I can to more to others, so I was called in 1999 to study at the Sola Scriptura Theological School. I am working as a supporting pastor and a pastor since 2002, and I was also called to be a youth leader for 8 years. During my service I have finished an addiction consultant training at Semmelweis University and since 2006 I regularly work among alcohol, drug and medicine addicts. Our residential rehabilitation program started in 2010, where as a professional leader I try to look over the work done there (find out more at <a href="http://www.alkoholbeteg.hu/" target="_blank">www.alkoholbeteg.hu</a>). In the last 10 years, I have visited many primary and secondary schools as well as camps, and I have made connections with many young people, in order to think together about the questions of addiction and breaking free. I have joined the Seventh - day Adventist church this September and continue my service as a pastor in the area of Balatonlelle.</p>

                <p>I was born in 1956, and currently live in Győr. I was teaching all age groups as a biology and art teacher for twenty years. I got my second degree at the Sola Scriptura theological college in 1993, and from that time, I was teaching Bible and Fine arts class until 2014. Since 1996, I am working as a pastor and missionary in God’s work. My wife, Zsuzsanna Horváth is also my coworker. I used to organize reading camps for young people (ages 14-20). Lately, in the past seven years we were organising scout camps for children (ages 7-14) with our coworkers. Also, in about the last 15 years, I was leading lifestyle camps. Since 1988, I am holding meetings and series mostly in western Hungary about topics like the Bible, healthy lifestyle, creation and evolution, child and youth rearing, and marriage care. I have summed up my researches and experiences in nine books. The goal of my work with the youth is to strengthen the boys and girls in their mission and vocation, „That our sons may be as plants grown up in their youth; that our daughters may be as corner stones, polished after the similitude of a palace” (Psalms 144:12).</p>

Together with my wife and our four children we work for the church in Szolnok. I have spent most part of my life and ministry outside the Seventh-day Adventist Church. A recently discovered treasure from the Scripture and the Testimonies gave a new meaning, opened a new dimension for my ministry. New light shone upon well known truths before my eyes. These discoveries played a key role in my joining to the World Church. I hope that by sharing these I may help young people, who desire to work for Christ.</p>

              <div class="description">
                <p>Do we live in a world in need of more young men of great intelligence and sophistication? What is the greatest want and need of this generation? How can the youth of the SDA movement be the catalyst and the element needed in this last generation. Can we be the generation that ends the world? This are the questions that we will tackle during this workshop and provide practical applications on reaching: higher than highest human thoughts can reach is Gods ideal for His children.<br>The bible teaches that we are not only hearers of the word of God but doers. Yet so often, after we share a critical truth with a friend or family member, no decision is made. How can we cooperate with the Holy Spirit in such a way as to gain decisions from many a soul in the valley of decision? How do we make our appeals with power, conviction and confidence? Come and learn how to bring people to the feet of Jesus, and allow the power of the cross for the individual to choose an unhindered life in these last days.</p>

              <div class="description">
                <p>I am convinced that there are two types of people. One group consists of addicts, the other group consists of those, who deny it. In my opinion, addiction goes together with existence, and through our bondages can we get to the state when we realise that we need a Saviour. I would like to share this process, my personal experiences and the realizations of my service among addicts, and I will also talk about what we can to others in our environment.

        The covered topics of the seminar will be:

                <p>Where is my place, what is my duty? Mission or struggling in the net of youth? (1Jn 2,14) Destruction or building? The pitfalls of a successful life based on the novel ‘A Colobre’ by Dino Buzatti. If everything seems beautiful from the outside, what is the problem eventually? Why do you live and what are you running from? What does you life talk about: Jesus, or Colombre? Pictures of God and distortions of them. <br>What is the secret of a spiritual life? How will the tree of your life become fruitful? (Jer. 17,5–6) Jesus wants to plant you from the desert next to the river. How can it happen? Where does the invisible roots and branches of your life reach? The secret of growing your root hairs in the direction of the river. What is the bole? Your flowers: the smell of life or the smell of death? Change from the roots - bearing fruits. „My roots will reach to the water, and the dew will lie all night on my branches.” (Jób 29,19)</p>

There are many mission methods, but there is one that you can use in almost every situation.<br>How can such small things set big local churches on  re? How can you gain experiences that you only dreamt of?<br>Come and be part of the GLOW story.</p>

                <h3>Church organization - on earth as it is in heaven...?</h3><span>Péter Erdődi - Imre Ócsai</span>
              </div>
              <div class="description">
                <p>What is the church? Who has invented the organization and what is its„raison d’etre”? Do I really need this anyway? Isn’t it sufficient to be connected to Christ only? Does it have anything to do with my salvation? Can we find the everlasting Gospel in the Seventh-day Adventist doctrine of the church? If you have ever asked any of these questions above then you are welcome to our interactive seminar, where we’ll find answers together from the Bible and the Spirit of Prophecy, that „the manifold wisdom of God might be known through the church” (Eph 3:10).</p>
